kulturpool_main("Helmker was a wealthy man with links to the Huosi, and St√∂rmer 1984, p. 664, was of the opinion he belonged to the Huosi, himself. It is generally assumed that Helmker was trying to establish a small monastery in Singenbach. He endowed the church dedicated to St. Peter that he had built there with generous property in Singenbach, Ried, Walkertshofen and Pleitmannswang (TF 118), and also gave himself to the church, and then conveyed it to the bishopric of Freising (TF 119). Helmker had a son, named Rekinhoh, who is mentioned in TF 119.")
